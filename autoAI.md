## Exercise: Using AutoAI to predict outcomes!

Estimated time needed: 45 mins

Objective for Exercise:

- How to create a project in Watson Studio Service and add a Watson Machine Learning Service.
- Learn how to utilize Watson AutoAI to predict the likelihood of a particular outcome based on input data.
- Create and Train a model using sample data.

You\'re on the marketing team for a bank and your team is launching a
new campaign. In order to launch the most effective campaign, you need
to determine who to target in the campaign based on the likelihood that
your target audience will respond to the messaging.

**NOTE**: For learners working to get a certificate for this course (i.e.
not auditing), please go through this exercise carefully and thoroughly
it will be used for the graded assignment that follows.

## Pre-requisites

You will need an IBM Cloud account to do this lab. If you have not created one already, click on this [link](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-CC0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/IBMCloud_accountCreation/CreateIBMCloudAccount.md.html) and follow the instructions to create an IBM Cloud account.

## Step 1: Add a Watson Machine Learning Service Instance

1. We need to add an instance of the Watson Machine Learning service to your account. This will be used later when you set up the rest of the assets for the project. From your Dashboard page, click or tap theÂ **Create Resource**Â button at the top right of the page.

2. From the catalog page that loads, Click on the **services**, select theÂ **AI**Â category and then select theÂ **Watson Machine Learning**Â service from the list.

## Step 2: Create a Watson Studio Resource

In this step, you will be using Watson Studio to see AI in action. If you already have a Watson Studio resource set up, you can skip to step 4.

To manage all your projects, you will use IBM Watson Studio. In this exercise, you will add Watson Studio as a Resource.

1. In the IBM Cloud **Catalog** go to the Watson Studio listing - [cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-studio)

2. On the Watson Studio page, select DALLAS as the Region, verify that the **Lite** plan is selected, and then click **Create**.
